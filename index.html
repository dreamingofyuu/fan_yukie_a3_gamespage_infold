      <p>Platform Played on: Mobile</p>
      <p>Number of Months played: 11</p>
      <p>Money spent: $30</p>
      <p>Favourite Character: Sylus</p>
      <p>Favourite Event: When Drakeshadows Fall</p>
      <p>Rating: 9.9/10</p>
      <p>Reason: Love and Deepspace is the game I currently play everyday. I first saw their ad on Instagram and immediately wanted to play. Their game is an Otome game, a dating simulator based on a female protagonist, and their concept was really unique to me. Albeit their plot gets a little confusing, their graphics are stunning, the events are easy to follow, and the characters are very attractive. Not just one or two that are clearly biased, but the company creates their characters to be equally attractive with their fair share of limited event cards. Different from most visual novels, this game incoporates battle sequences to allow it to truly feel like a game rather than just a boring grind for character affection.</p>
